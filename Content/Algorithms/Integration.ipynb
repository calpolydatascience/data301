So long as the desired accuracy does not exceed the fundamental limit set by the machine precision of our computer— the rounding error that limits all calculations—then it should always be possible to meet our goal by using a large enough number of steps.

    "There are three functions for computing integrals given only samples: `trapz` , `simps`, and `romb`.  The trapezoidal rule approximates the function as a straight line between adjacent points while Simpson’s rule approximates the function between three adjacent points as a parabola, as we have already seen. The first two functions can also handle non-equally-spaced samples (something we did not code ourselves) which is a useful extension to these integration rules.\n",

    "If the samples are equally-spaced and the number of samples available is $2^k+1$ for some integer $k$, then Romberg integration can be used to obtain high-precision estimates of the integral using the available samples. Romberg integration is an adaptive method that uses the trapezoid rule at step-sizes related by a power of two and then performs something called Richardson extrapolation on these estimates to approximate the integral with a higher-degree of accuracy. (A different interface to Romberg integration useful when the function can be provided is also available as `romberg`)."
